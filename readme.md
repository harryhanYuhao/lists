## OS

The kernel and the operations system.

### Linux: Fedora, Debian, Arch, NixOs, etc

There are many operation system based on the linux-kernel. The most well-known ones are Debian, Arch, and RHEL.

Most of these operation system are fully functional, well written, open sourced, but they carries different design flavour. 

Debian carries the traditional software development paradigm. It is famous for its stability, and many other distributions are developed based on this stable ground: Ubuntu, Mint, the gaming platform Steamos, and the Chinese Linux Deepin.

RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux), developed and supported by Red Hat, is widely used by the enterprise. Fedora is another popular system that is the upstream of RHEL, that is, fedora is like the mice in the medical experiments.

Arch linux, unlike most other software, does not have 'stable release'. Instead, it is continuously developed on and released thereafter: this is called rolling release. Arch is also famous for its AUR: a software repository 
that is developped by its user, which enables Arch to have one of the most comprehensive software repository.

Nixos is also speical in another way.

Alpine.

### BSD 

### Windows and Macos

Closed source, non-free software not suitable for development, but unable to be ignored as most of the people in the world use them. Richard Stallman calls them "Malware".

### Relic OS

The OS world table may seem mundane: very few new players are presented on stage. Yet, if we allow relics from the past, there are Minix, Gnu-Hurd, and many others.
