## OS

The kernel and the operations system.

### Linux: Fedora, Debian, Arch, NixOs, etc

There are many operation system based on the linux-kernel. The most well-known ones are Debian, Arch, and RHEL.

All these operation system are stable, well maintained, open sourced, but each with a different design flavour. 

#### Debian 

Debian is a free and open source linux distribution built by the community. 
It is famous for its stability, and many other distributions are developed based on Debian: Ubuntu, Mint, and the Chinese Linux Deepin. 
The gaming platform SteamOS was based on Debian initially but later moved to Arch.

Debian team developped dpkg software package management system and the famous .deb package format.
Debian use apt-get package manager. 

Ubuntu is a famouse derivative of Debian created by Canonical. 
It is popular because it was one of the first linux distribution that focused on user friendiness. 
Its popularity is waning as more user-friendly distributions are available today. 
In addition, Ubuntu faces the criticism of leaking user data and installing system-wise advertisement. 

#### RHEL, Fedora, and CentOS

RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux) is widely used by the enterprises. RedHat Inc offer extensive support for it with a charge. 
Fedora, also sponsored by RedHat but developed by the community, is the upstream distribution of RHEL. 
CentOS is a free and community supported distribution based on RHEL. 

All of these system uses rpm package management system with the .rpm package format.

#### Arch and Derivatives

Arch is famous for three things: simplicity, rolling release, and AUR.

Arch linux, unlike most other softwares, does not have a stable release. 
Instead, it is continuously developed on and released immediately thereafter: this is called rolling release. 
Arch is also famous for its AUR: a software repository 
that is developped by its user, which enables Arch to have one of the most comprehensive software repository.

#### Others 

NixOs is radically innovative distribtion: all of its system are defined by one config file.

Alpine Linux: another special one which does not use GNU software.

### BSD 

### Windows and Macos

Closed source, non-free software not suitable for development, but unable to be ignored as most of the people in the world use them. Richard Stallman calls them "Malware".

### OS of the Relics

The OS world table may seem mundane: very few new players are presented on stage. Yet, if we allow relics from the past, there are Minix, Gnu-Hurd, and many others.
