# Math Resources

## Analysis 

- Mathematical Analysis , Tom M. Apostol
    - This is a gem.
- Analysis I, and Analysis II, Terence Tao
- Complex Analysis, Joseph Bak, Donald J. Newman. Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics, Springer. 
    - Classic Textbook in Complex Analysis. Very friendly and readable. In general, complex analysis shall be studied after real analysis.
- Analysis I, and Analysis II, Serge Lang
    - More advanced.

## Topology

- J.R. Munkres, Topology, a first course.
    - Classic in Topology
- G. Bredon, Topology and Geometry
- Introduction to Topological Manifolds, John M Lee, Springer

The following books are more elementary and reader friendly:

- Metric Space, Robert Magnus, Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics Springer. 

## Algebra

- Algebra I and II, PM Cohn
    - A comprehensive and friendly introduction. This book is hard to find, however.
- Linear Algebra Done Right, Sheldon Axler
    - By an American and a non-traditionalist. He does everything differently. But explainations are friendly and enlightening.
- Algebra, Serge Lang
    - An encyclopeidia
- Introduction to Commutative Algebra M.F. Atiyah, I.G. MacDonald
- Undergraduate Commutative Algebra, Miles Reid
- Commutative Algebra, with a view toward Algebraic Geometry, David Eisenbud
    
I found the following books not as helpful:
- Algebra, Michael Artin
    - The explanations and structure of the book are poor.

## Geometry 

### Differential geometry

- Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces, Manfredo P. do Carmo
    - An elementary book on real curves and surfaces, can be thought as a further course on calculus.
- Introduction to Smooth Manifolds, John M. Lee. Springer
    - Has great explanations, perfect for introductory differential geometry.

### Algebraic Geometry 

- Ideals, Varieties, and Algorithms, David Cox, John Little, Donal O'Shea
    - An elementary introduction to commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.
- Basic Algebraic Geometry (1,2), Shafarevich
- Algebraic Curves and Riemann Surfaces, Rick Miranda
    - Encyclopedia
- Algebraic Geometry, Robin Hartshorne
    - Again, an encyclopeidia. You need to be extremely relentless even finish the first several chapters.

## Set Theory 

- Naive Set Theory, Paul R, Halmos

## Number Theory 

- Elementary Number Theory, by Kenneth H. Rosen 

## Graph Theory

- Introduction to Graph Theory, by Robin J Wilson

## Miscellaneous

- How to Solve It, George Polya
- Mathematics and Plausible Reasoning, George Polya
- Mathematics and Its History, John Stillwell
- Proofs from the Book, Martin Aigner, GÃ¼nter M. Ziegler
- The Art of Computer Programming Series, Donald Knuth 
    - In reality this book is all about math. It provides a very comprehensive and rigorous introduction to mathematic algorithms and their applications in computer science.

## Advanced Topics 

Any book by Jean-Pierre Serre. 

- Lie Groups, Lie Algebras, and Representations, Brian C. Hall, Springer
