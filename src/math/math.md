# Maths Resources

## Undergraduate Level

### Analysis 

- Mathematical Analysis , Tom M. Apostol
    - This is a gem.
- Analysis I, and Analysis II, Terence Tao
- Complex Analysis, Joseph Bak, Donald J. Newman. Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics, Springer. 
    - Classic Textbook in Complex Analysis. Very friendly and readable.
- Analysis I, and Analysis II, Serge Lang
    - More advanced.

### Point Set Topology and Metric Spaces

-  Topology, a first course, J.R. Munkres
    - Classic introductory text on Topology. Hard to find a paper copy but definitely worth to have one.
- Metric Space, Robert Magnus, Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics Springer. 

### Algebraic Topology

- Algebraic Topology, Allen Hatcher.

### Algebra

- Algebra I, II, and III, PM Cohn
    - A comprehensive and friendly introduction. This book is hard to find, however.
- Introduction to Commutative Algebra M.F. Atiyah, I.G. MacDonald

### Differential geometry

- Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces, Manfredo P. do Carmo
    - An elementary book on real curves and surfaces, can be thought as a further course on calculus.
- Introduction to Smooth Manifolds, John M. Lee. Springer
    - Has great explanations, perfect for introductory differential geometry.

### Algebraic Geometry 

- Ideals, Varieties, and Algorithms, David Cox, John Little, Donal O'Shea
    - An elementary introduction to commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.
- Basic Algebraic Geometry (1,2), Shafarevich

### Set Theory 

- Naive Set Theory, Paul R, Halmos

### Number Theory 

- Elementary Number Theory, by Kenneth H. Rosen 
- A Course in Computational Algebraic Number Theory, Henri Cohen

### Graph Theory

- Introduction to Graph Theory, by Robin J Wilson


## Advanced Mathematics 

### Homological Algebra and Algebraic Topology

- Elements of Algebraic Topology, Munkres
- An Introduction to Homological Algebra, Rotman

### Category Theory 

- Basic Category Theory, Tom Leinster 
- Categories for the Working Mathematician, Saunders Mac Lane

### Algebra

- Commutative Algebra, with a view toward Algebraic Geometry, David Eisenbud
- Algebraic Geometry, Robin Hartshorne
    - Again, an encyclopeidia. You need to be extremely relentless even finish the first several chapters.

### Others 

- A Course on Arithmetic, Jean-Pierre Serre
- Lie Groups, Lie Algebras, and Representations, Brian C. Hall, Springer

## General Problem Solving

- How to Solve It, George Polya
- Mathematics and Plausible Reasoning, George Polya
- Mathematics and Its History, John Stillwell
- Proofs from the Book, Martin Aigner, Günter M. Ziegler
- The Art of Computer Programming Series, Donald Knuth 
    - In reality this book is all about math. It provides a very comprehensive and rigorous introduction to mathematic algorithms and their applications in computer science.

## Too Read

- Any book by Jean-Pierre Serre. 
- Probabilistic Method, Alon and Spencer
