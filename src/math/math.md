## Analysis 

### Real And Complex Analysis

Real analysis lays the foundation of calculus. By studying the properties of real numbers, sequences, and series, it provides rigor for differentiation and integration. 
Complex analysis is real analysis equipped with complex struture. Complex number, as you may expect, behaves very differently from real number and very interesting consequences ensue.

- Analysis I, and Analysis II, Terence Tao
    - This series is a famed introduction to real analysis: but it only touches very slightly on certain important topics, such as lebesgue integration and measure.
- Mathematical Analysis , Tom M. Apostol
    - An comprehensive introduction to real analysis, but also includes some advanced topics. There seems to be few good and readable textbooks on analysis. This one is a gem.
- Complex Analysis, Joseph Bak, Donald J. Newman. Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics, Springer. 
    - Classic Textbook in Complex Analysis. Very friendly and readable. In general, complex analysis shall be studied after real analysis.
- Analysis I, and Analysis II, Serge Lang
    - A more rigorous and advanced introduction to real analysis.

### Topology

In analysis one may realise that real number is not the requirements, instead certain properties of real number brings about all the important results. These properties includes the order, completeness, unboundedness, triangle inequality, etc. Topology studies these any arbitrary space with these properties.

- J.R. Munkres, Topology, a first course.
    - Classic in Topology
- G. Bredon, Topology and Geometry
- Introduction to Topological Manifolds, John M Lee, Springer

The followings ones are more elementary and reader friendly:

- Metric Space, Robert Magnus, Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics Springer. 
    - As a very friendly introduction to metric space, it is a nice companion to elementary analysis. Metric space, in general, can be seen as a preliminary topology and an extension of real analysis.

## Algebra

It is hard to describe algebra to someone who has not learned it, but this could be a invitation for you to learn algebra: 
Mathematicians has tried for centuries to find a general solution to quintic polynomials in complex number. All attempts has failed, until Abel and Galois discovered group theory (a branch of algebra) and used it to prove there is no general solution to quintic polynomials. Algebra is a completely different approach and perspective to mathematics.

Perhaps more people are familiar with linear algebra (matrices, vector space, etc) because of its ubiquitous applications in physics, engineering, and computer science. 
Many people may hold the wrong notion that linear algebra is the only algebra they need to know. I think this is not true. Many properties of linear algebra can only be understood in the context of wider algebra.

- Algebra, Michael Artin
    - Undergraduate level classic and comprehensive introduction to algebra (including linear algebra).
- Linear Algebra Done Right, Sheldon Axler
    - This one is rather peculiar, a famous book introducing a very different approach to linear algebra from the traditional one. Namely, this book tires to avoid determinants as far as possible. I think determinants are very natural and useful, so I prefer Artin's traditional approach.
- Algebra, Serge Lang
    - Very advanced, rigorous, and comprehensive book on algebra.

I found the following books not as helpful:

- Algebra, Michael Artin
    - The explanations and structure of the book is poor.

### Commutative Algebra 

- Introduction to Commutative Algebra M.F. Atiyah, I.G. MacDonald
- Undergraduate Commutative Algebra, Miles Reid
- Commutative Algebra, with a view toward Algebraic Geometry, David Eisenbud
    
## Geometry 

### Differential geometry

Differential geometry can be thought as an extention to calculus. 
Calculus studies area, length, and other properties of curves and surfaces in Euclidean space (1D, 2D, 3D, etc) with integral and differentiations. 
Differential geometry deals with, in one hand, more complex surfuces in Euclidean space, studying properties like curvature and objects like geodesics using integration and differentiations. 
It also studies surfaces on more abstract space, called manifolds, which exhibit very different properties from Euclidean space. 
Of course, one of the formost task is to define what is a manifold, and how to do differentiations (called exterior differentiations) and integrations (opposite of differentiation using pullbacks) on any arbitrary manifolds. These definitions utilise advanced methods in topology, algebra, and analysis.

#### Classic and Comphrehensive books

- Introduction to Smooth Manifolds, John M. Lee. Springer
    - Comphrehensive and reader-friendly

#### Beginner friendly 

- Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces, Manfredo P. do Carmo
    - A friendly introduction to application of differential geometry into 3D curves and surface.
- A Geometric Approach to Differential Forms, David Bachman
    - A gental introduction to a preliminary topic in differential geometry: differential forms.

### Algebraic Geometry 

Algebraice geometry is generally considered more advanced than differential geometry, as it demands a greater understanding in algebra, topology, and analysis, and deal with more abstract objects. 
Here is one example: in differential geometry 2-torus is defined parametrically in 3D Euclidean space: a straigth forward approach. 
In algebraic geometry 2-complex-torus can be defined, quite surprisingly, as a quotient space C^2 / Z^2, where C is the complex plane and Z^2 is the lattice of complex integer numbers, equipped with the canonical topology. (Quotiens Space is a notion in algebra, I refer to you Artin's Algebra for reference)

- Ideals, Varieties, and Algorithms, David Cox, John Little, Donal O'Shea
    - A more friendly and readable introduction to algebraic geometry and some applications at undergraduate level.
- Algebraic Geometry, Robin Hartshorne
    - A more advanced and comprehensive introduction to algebraic geometry.

## Miscellaneous

- How to Solve It, George Polya
- Mathematics and Plausible Reasoning, George Polya
    - These two are introductory level books on logics and problem solving.

    - Besides history, it also provides a preview of important topics in mathematics and includes very interesting problems as exercises.
- Proofs from the Book, Martin Aigner, GÃ¼nter M. Ziegler
    - A collection of beautiful and elegant proofs in mathematics. This book includes very advanced topics.

    - In reality this book is all about math. It provides a very comprehensive and rigorous introduction to mathematic algorithms and their applications in computer science.

## Advanced Topics 

Any book by Jean-Pierre Serre. 

## Self Study Guide 

To learn math is challenging, let alone to learn it by yourself. Yet, it is possible, and will be a rewarding experience. 

Currently I am a third year undergraduate studying math, so my perspective is limited. I would, however, provide my thoughts and hope for it to be helpful. 

Start with elementary analysis and algebra. Study next complex variable and metric space. After these you can challenge yourself with differential geometry. While studying geometry, it is important to keep learning more advanced topics in algebra and analysis. After these one can pick up topology and then algebraic geometry. You can also study side topics like number theory and combinatorics on the way.
